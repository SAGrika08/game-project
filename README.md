# game-project: Bloom Cycle

# game-overview
Bloom Cycle is a browser-based arcade shooter inspired by the classic Space Invaders format. In the game, the player controls a gardener who protects a garden from waves of pests and bugs. Instead of a combat-focused or sci-fi theme, the enemies represent environmental threats, and clearing them helps maintain the health of the garden while increasing the player’s score.

This game was built as part of a project requirement to create a browser-based game using JavaScript. I chose this structure because a familiar arcade format allowed me to focus on implementing core mechanics efficiently, while re-theming the gameplay around environmental protection made the experience more educational and meaningful.
