//THEME 
/* BloomCycle
BloomCycle is a arcade game where you look after a tiny garden. 
Good habits show up as things like water drops or sunlight, and bad 
habits appear as little weeds or pests. When you collect the helpful 
ones and clear the harmful ones, the garden slowly comes to life with 
new colors and flowers. It’s meant to feel calm and rewarding, like 
watching something grow because of your small choices.

CraveCatcher
CraveCatcher is about noticing cravings before they take over. Different 
cravings drift toward you—maybe a sugar hit, a late-night snack, or a 
stress-eating moment—and you respond with simple actions like drinking 
water or taking a quick pause. When you make a good choice, the game 
gives you a quick burst of feedback so it feels satisfying. The idea is to 
make eating habits feel light and playful rather than heavy.


 Life Systems
Life Systems is a balancing game based on four main parts of life: 
health, work, relationships, and rest. Each one moves toward you in its 
own pattern, and you can only handle one at a time. When you put energy 
into one area, the others start to speed up, so the challenge is keeping 
everything in check without letting anything crash. The aim is to show how
 juggling these four pillars often feels in real life—simple on the surface, 
 but always shifting.
